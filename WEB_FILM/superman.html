                    The 2025 Superman movie, directed by James Gunn, is a reboot of the Superman film series, focusing on a younger Clark Kent/Superman as he navigates his dual identity and grapples with the complexities of being a superhero in a world that has become somewhat jaded by extraordinary events. The film explores his journey of self-discovery, embracing his flaws, and learning to be a hero through acts of kindness and courage. It also features a diverse cast of characters from the Superman mythos, including Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and the Justice League, with a focus on their interactions and Clark's developing relationships. <br>
