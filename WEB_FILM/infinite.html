                    "Infinite" is a 2021 science fiction action film directed by Antoine Fuqua. The film tells the story of Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg), a man diagnosed with schizophrenia who discovers he has memories from his past lives. He joins a secret group called the "Infinites," people who have the ability to remember all their previous lives. This group is divided into two camps: Believers who use their knowledge for good, and Nihilists who want to end the cycle of reincarnation. Evan, who turns out to be the reincarnation of the legendary Infinite named Heinrich Treadway, must be involved in the battle between the two camps to save the world.<br>
